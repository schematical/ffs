                                            These scripts can also interfere with features like mouse gestures.
                                            Nothing (including these scripts) can prevent anyone from copying your
                                            source or images. The browser cannot display your document without the
                                            source and images, so your web server must send them to the browser. Even
                                            without the various "save" functions in today's browsers, someone can
                                            retrieve your source or images from the browser's cache, request them from
                                            the server with some other tool, or use a screen-capture tool to copy the
                                            images.
                                            These scripts do nothing when JavaScript is disabled or unavailable, when
                                            JavaScript access to right-click events is disabled, on systems without

                                            necessary for the browser to be able to retrieve your document. It is
                                            impossible to hide the URL of a resource from the browser.</p>

                                        <h4>How do I detect what browser is being used?</h4>

                                        <p>Many browsers identify themselves when they request a document. A CGI script
                                            will have this information available in the HTTP_USER_AGENT environment
                                            variable, and it can use that to send out a version of the document which is
                                            optimized for that browser.</p>

                                        <p>Keep in mind not all browsers identify themselves correctly. For example,
                                            Microsoft Internet Explorer identifies itself as Netscape Navigator, and
                                            many other browsers identify themselves as Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>

                                        <p>And of course, if a cache proxy keeps a version intended for one brower,
                                            someone with another browser may get that version, rather than the version
                                            intended for the other browser.</p>

                                    </div>
                                </li>

                                        <h4>How do I get my visitors' email addresses?</h4>

                                        <p>You can't. Although each request for a document is usually logged with the
                                            name or address of the remote host, the actual username is almost never
                                            logged as well. This is mostly because of performance reasons, as it would
                                            require that the server uses the ident protocol to see who is on the other
                                            end. This takes time. And if a cache proxy is doing the request, you don't
                                            get anything sensible.</p>

                                        <p>But just stop to think for a minute... would you really want every single
                                            site you visit to know your email address? Imagine the loads of automated
                                            thank you's you would be receiving. If you visited 20 sites, you would get
                                            at least 20 emails that day, plus no doubt they would send you invitations
                                            to return later. It would be a nightmare as well as an invasion of
                                            privacy!</p>

                                        <h4>Why is my custom 404 Not Found message not displayed?</h4>

                                        <p>If only Internet Explorer ignores your custom 404 Not Found messages, then
                                            you've been caught by its "friendly" HTTP error messages. When a special
                                            HTTP response (e.g., a 404 Not Found response) is shorter than 512 bytes,
                                            Internet Explorer substitutes its own message for the one delivered by the
                                            server. As a user of Internet Explorer, you can disable this feature in the
                                            "Advanced" options panel. As a web author, your only recourse is to make
                                            your 404 Not Found message longer.</p>
