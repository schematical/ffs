                                            Selling custom merchandise printed on demand at big competitions is common. However, long lines frequently deter some parents from purchasing your competition merchandise. Allow friends and family to purchase and customize competition gear that you can deliver to your athletes during awards.  Of course grandma in Florida can purchase and customize competition gear for her favorite athlete.
